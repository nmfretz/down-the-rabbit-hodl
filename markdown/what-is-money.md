It may seem like a strange place to start, but understanding the concept of money is an extremely important foundation for understanding the "why" of Bitcoin. If you haven't thought much about money before, try answering the following question: what is money and what gives it any value? Confusing right? The topic is made even more confusing by the fact that different economic schools of thought think about money differently (Austrian Economics versus Modern Monetary Theory). I encourage you to look for resources outside of the ones I have listed here to find differing or dissenting opinions on what money is.

Read this article by Lyn Alden. It is the best history and explanation of money that I have read online. The article includes sections on the cypherpunk movement and Bitcoin, both of which are covered later in this guide.

Okay, are you back here without reading the entire article because it is quite dense and contains a lot of economic concepts? If that is the case, please at least read this much lighter history of money by Haseeb Qureshi.

This short video below is a dramatized supercut of a 1984 interview with Friedrich Hayek, where he talks about the development of money and monetary policy. This is where the Friedrich Hayek quote from the Lyn Alden article originated.

<p class="quote">
"I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can’t stop." - Friedrich Hayek
