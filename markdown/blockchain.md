<h3>How Bitcoin Works Under the Hood (22:25)</h3>
<p>This video from back in 2013 has stood the test of time. There are a few out-of-date statements due to the evolving Bitcoin ecosystem (e.g., most modern user-focused wallet providers do not require you to personally download the history of the blockchain). This video is a great one to watch after the 3Blue1Brown video because it covers more aspects of the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
